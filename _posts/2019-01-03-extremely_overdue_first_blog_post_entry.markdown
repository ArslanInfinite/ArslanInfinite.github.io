Hello everyone, my name is Arslan Ali. "Ars" rhymes with parse, and "lan" rhymes with on. Ali shouldn't be a problem because boxing. I've been in the software industry for numerous years now but as a software tester, both manual and automation. I graduated with a degree in CS and have been making my way around a few states working for both the private and public sectors. 

I decided to make the change from testing to development after reading up on shifting employment trends over the last few years. I believe that the skills I've acquired put me in a relatively good position in terms of jump starting on the software development side of things, as I think some of the languages I've learned translate over to Javascript, at the least. 

After some delays I've been on track to completing Ruby, which I've found to be  easy enough to pick up, granted one has an intense focus on it. I do disagree with the common theme that companies spout about learning software languages is both fun and easy. It's not, at least the easy the part. It's pretty stressful when you're working with an imposing deadline and if you think it's easy, you're doing something wrong. With that said it's a pretty rewarding experience when your code passes all tests within the scope of acceptable bug count, and you can see the end result shipped out into the real world. Additional client feedback is another challenge you'll come across post-production, but it's better for everyone when you add new feaures or address existing bugs. 

Over the last few years with the rise of DevOps and CICD, I think development and testing has slowly merged, and I want to be on the forefront of all things software going forward. I hope to make the most of my Flatiron experience. 

Regards, 

Arslan Ali
